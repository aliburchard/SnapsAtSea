Astronomy (but also other projects),Both,Prefer not to say,I prefer the yes/no one. But as for the Survey one : are our classifications for bird/seal/etc useful in any way ? If no. Why don't you just ask the question : do you see the underside of a fluke and even why don't you combine snapshots at sea and whales as individuals : And ask the underside of the fluke question and if yes let them classify the fluke.,Computer

"When I relate to and understand the research purpose (ie life sciences but not astronomy - I just do not 'get' it; maybe later but prefer to stick for now to selected projects until completion - which could take a while though :-) ). When I feel that I can do the task and can improve as I do more classifications. The type of projects can vary though, I actually enjoy having a few projects opened at teh same time and alternate between types such as transcription or marking",Both,Both,It depends on my mood.

Nature  projects,Both,Survey Workflow,"Still able to view all the images of all the wildlife which is great, but as the final objective is to identify whale flukes it is a little frustrating to repeatedly be seeing images that aren't even whales. Perhaps if you decide to continue with the yes/no scenario a slightly more direct approach might be a good compromise. eg - is there a whale/dolphin in this image for the starting question would eliminate a lot of the images in the first round. or use the animal type survey question to sort the birds/ seals&otters/ no animals/ fish from the whales then progress to yes no answers ",Computer

Cat Cam Panthera I enjoy the most. Both in Africa and Indo China. There's so much diversity in species and they use very good quality camera's.,Both,Survey Workflow,"The Yes/no workflow is so ridiculous easy that it becomes very dull after a minute. Of course, one can click very quick through the images but it doesn't give a challenge. The survey asks more attention from me, because I have to do different tasks to mark the whales tail etc. Here also the diversity in activity gives me more challenge and keeps it more interesting.",Computer

You can get through more images so more worthwhile if you have  limited time to spend on it and still felt as if you were contributing.  On the other hand, Survey means you can help with more in-depth information.  However, if I had to choose would probably opt for Yes/No",Computer
